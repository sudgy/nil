This is part of my stupid project to write a compiler from the ground up.  I
started with a hex editor writing ELF files directly, and the plan is to go from
there to writing a small self-assembler, adding more features to the assembler,
writing a small compiler, then adding more features to the compiler.  Right now
I have a small self-assembler going.
